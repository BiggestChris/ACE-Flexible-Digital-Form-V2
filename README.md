# ACE-Flexible-Digital-Form-V1
 
A lot of code for this submission was derived from my earlier work expanding out the Leaven Pizza digital menu app, specifically linking it to Firebase for real-time data submission and collection.

Currently this functions by taking a static webform, and then whenever the user types in it, it updates to a real-time database (no 'upload'/'submit' button is pressed), with the values filled in and a timestamp to identify the latest submission.

The webform itself functions on a desktop and a mobile, and has been specifically optimised for mobile use.
